Settings
========

This repository contains a bunch of my default configuration files.

This is mainly for my personal use, but you may feel free to use the configurations as well (at your own risk..).

**Note:** This setup is intended for hosts that are basically *single-user hosts* (all accounts are used by me), so I prefer to have settings applied globally without having to configure each user separately.
For multi-user hosts though, you should place some configurations (vimrc,..) into the `/home` folders of users instead of the global `/etc` configuration!
